<span class="counts">[[0127 From Insight to Love#^12-1|12-1]]</span>

---
##### Q1: contemplation of death
###### Thinking about dying sometime centres me, other times it brings up fear
<span class="counts">**[[0127 From Insight to Love#^12-3|12-3]]**: _[[Impermanence]] · [[Death]] (2) · [[Habit]] · [[Fear]]_</span>

##### Q2: three characteristics implying each other
###### Does understanding one help understanding the others?
<span class="counts">**[[0127 From Insight to Love#^12-7|12-7]]**: _[[Insight]] (2)_</span>

---
###### Something is impermanent, therefore automatically unsatisfactory

---
###### The resulting letting go is not disconnection, and it can lead to an understanding of anatta
<span class="counts">**[[0127 From Insight to Love#^13-1|13-1]]**: _[[Freedom]] · [[Impermanence]] (4) · [[Letting go]] · [[Insight]] · [[Anatta]] · [[The Self]]_</span>

![[20070127-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-from_insight_to_love-12291.mp3#t=01:03:11]]

```ad-quote
The [sense of self](app://obsidian.md/The%20Self) is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So impermanence can lead to the others like that.
```

---
###### Is it a lower level of understanding if I do not approach a characteristic directly?
<span class="counts">**[[0127 From Insight to Love#^13-2|13-2]]**: _[[Impermanence]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

---
###### Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge

```ad-quote
But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough freedom. There's plenty of freedom in that.
```

---
###### Can the more direct understanding come from more practice?
<span class="counts">**[[0127 From Insight to Love#^13-6|13-6]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Anatta]]_</span>

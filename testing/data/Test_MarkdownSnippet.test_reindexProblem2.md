So, as I said, all this, what we're talking about on this [[retreat]], and the teachings about [[eros]] and [[desire]], has a context. Now, there are also the contexts of areas and themes in the teachings that have interested me very much over the years, and that I have tried to share with others over the years as well. I've talked in the past - I think, if I remember, there's a talk called "[[Passion, Desire, and the Path]]"^[Rob Burbea, "Passion, Desire, and the Path" (16 March 2007), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/12343/](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/12343/)]; one was about "A [[Wise Relationship to Practice]],"^[Rob Burbea, "A Wise Relationship to Practice" (28 Jan. 2010), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/9538/](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/9538/)] I think it's called; and "[[Wise Effort]],"^[Rob Burbea, "Talk Three: Wise Effort and Wise Attachment" (10 Aug. 2008), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11516/](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11516/)] looking at more the micro-movement of effort and [[desire]] in, for example, _[[samatha]]_ practice and _[[Jhanas|jhƒÅna]]_ practice and that kind of thing; and other talks I can't remember. I think I might try on this [[retreat]] and do something that might be a little annoying, but hopefully it's more helpful than annoying, and mention other places where you can find more about certain strands or elements of teaching that are involved in what we're talking about. I'm going to mention, but maybe not fill out more, so that if you want more you have a place to look.

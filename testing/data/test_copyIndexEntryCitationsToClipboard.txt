> So those would be two examples of areas where a preliminary becomes [[Soul|ensouled]], and then it becomes something that's potentially - I don't know - the opposite of preliminary: super advanced. But the same could be said of something like _[[Dana|dāna]]_, or even [[mindfulness]]. Lots of possibilities there in relation to this idea of [[preliminaries]]. And again, to touch on this thread - I'll keep coming back to this, the 'why' of all this, and repeat something I think I said yesterday - why preliminaries? Why these exercises, these kinds of exercises? Why even _think_ in terms of exercises or preliminaries? As I said, we can just hope that the [[soulmaking dynamic]] - we know, we've heard, or we've even had [[experience]] of the soulmaking dynamic - what it does is it will expand things. It will expand its range. It will include more and more. And it will expand something that it's kind of got in its vortex, in its dynamics - some area or aspect of our being or our life. It expands that area. We expand with it. Our [[Insight|understanding]] and our experience of that area or aspect of being expands with it, or shatters in the [[Vessel|breaking of the vessels]], and then has to be built in a larger way, a deeper, fuller, more far-reaching way. _([[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#3-4|3-4]])_

> [15:46] So it might be that we can just hope that if we're practising [[soulmaking]], we like it, practising, and we can just hope that the [[soulmaking dynamic]] will expand, will get hold in its expansion or in the [[Vessel|breaking of vessels]] that happens occasionally, from time to time (sometimes it's just a stretch; sometimes it's actually a shattering), in that whole process, over time, that eventually it will just, by itself, come to involve and include and ensoul [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]]. You can just hope that, because that's what the soulmaking dynamic does. _([[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#4-1|4-1]])_

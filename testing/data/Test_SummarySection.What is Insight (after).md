### Paragraphs

##### This talk is about putting things in place
**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-1|1-1]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Meditation]] · [[Conceptual Framework]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:02]]

---
##### Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks
**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-2|1-2]]**: _[[Personality types]] (2) · [[Conceptual Framework]] · [[Dharma]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:57]]

---
##### Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting
**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-3|1-3]]**: _[[Dharma]] (3) · [[Insight]] · [[Personality types]] · [[Experience]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=01:50]]

---
##### General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering
**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Insight]] (12) · [[Dukkha]] (7) · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Meditation]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=03:15]]

```ad-quote
So any seeing or understanding that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of dukkha - that's what we call "insight." Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just intellectual understanding, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of suffering, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an insight.
```

```ad-quote
Any situation, any experience, you can apply insight to, insight is relevant.
```

---
##### Example: talking to someone in an accusing way
**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Insight]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=04:46]]

---
##### 3 kinds of insights
**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (2) · [[Ways of Looking]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=05:52]]

---
##### (1) Personal insight into one's own habits of body, speech and mind
**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Habit]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=06:17]]

---
##### Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies
**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Habit]] · [[Insight]] · [[Dukkha]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=07:30]]

---
##### Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts
**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Metta]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Steadiness]] · [[Psychological maturity]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=08:24]]

---
##### Example: being more in touch with the heart vs the mind
**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Beauty]] · [[Emotions]] (2) · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Personhood]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=09:01]]

```ad-quote
Just to know, what's the weakness, what's the strength, what needs some work? What's a strength? Do we know, do we acknowledge and appreciate our strengths?
```

---
##### Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful?
**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Stories]] (7) · [[Fantasy]] · [[Insight]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=10:11]]

---
##### It's not easy to navigate and inquire into those stories
**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Healing]] · [[Stories]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=11:18]]

```ad-quote
Is the story helpful? And if so, how? And is it not helpful? And if so, how? And is it possible to actually tell myself a different story, to rewrite my story? And actually, yes, that is possible.
```

---
##### No story can ever be the whole truth
**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Freedom]] · [[Stories]] · [[Insight]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=12:39]]

```ad-quote
Any story we have of ourselves can never, even if it's very beautiful, even if it's very compelling, even if it seems completely obvious, it can never be the whole truth. There's no way. Truth as such is bigger than anything you can fit it into.
```

---
##### (2) Universal insights, for all beings and all things
**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Impermanence]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=13:35]]

```ad-quote
So most obvious example would be impermanence. It's just true for everyone and all things.
```

```ad-warning
"universal insights" <> "ultimate insights", i.e. index entry is wrong
```

---
##### Personal and universal truths help us to respond well to conventional reality
**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-4|4-4]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] (5) · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Feelings]] · [[Relationships]] (3) · [[Conventional reality]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=14:04]]

```ad-warning
add more "world of" index entries
```

---
##### (3) Ultimate truth is beyond words, transcends any of the other
**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Awakening]] · [[Insight]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=15:45]]

---
##### Do we give equal attention to the conventional and the ultimate?
**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Attention]] (2) · [[Conventional reality]] (4) · [[Ultimate Truth]] (2) · [[Spiritual circles]] (2) · [[Relationships]] · [[Feelings]] · [[Healing]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=16:10]]

---
##### Another universal insight: it's a good idea to practice
**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Dukkha]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=17:31]]

---
##### It's a good idea to practice generosity
**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Insight]] (2) · [[Generosity]] (2) · [[Happiness]] · [[Buddha]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=18:12]]

```ad-quote
This is an insight, to really care what I put out into the world, the vibrations that I'm putting out there, what's reverberating in my wake.
```

---
##### What qualities do I need to cultivate that actually lead to a lessening of suffering
**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-5|5-5]]**: _[[Ethics]] (2) · [[Generosity]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Happiness]] · [[Pleasantness]] · [[Cultivation]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Ultimate Truth]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=19:12]]

```ad-quote
universal insights, they're not one-off insights.
```

```ad-quote
Actually we need to see this over and over and over and over and over, until finally the coin drops, and seeing it over and over, and practicing it, it deepens. The insight deepens and becomes unshakeable, becomes unshakeable.
```

---
##### Unshakeable knowing is pretty rate
**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Personhood]] · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Devotion]] · [[Generosity]] · [[Meditation]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=20:28]]

---
##### "Insights arise", often from trusting mindfulness
**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Dharma]] (4) · [[Insight]] (5) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Mindfulness]] (6) · [[Attention]] · [[Present Moment]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=21:24]]

---
##### Taking care of insight through taking care of ethics and samadhi
**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Buddha]] · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Ethics]] (2) · [[Steadiness]] (2) · [[Samadhi]] (3)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=22:43]]

---
##### "Insights arising" vs "using insights"
**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Retreat]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Letting go]] · [[Impermanence]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=23:05]]

```ad-quote
Usually, though, it takes some acting on. You actually need to consolidate it.
```

---
##### To consolidate the insight needs us to act on it
**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Retreat]] · [[Insight]] (4) · [[Perception]] (2) · [[Love]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Devotion]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=24:20]]

---
##### Insight is like a muscle, if we don't use it it will atrophy
**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Habit]] · [[Love]] (2) · [[Generosity]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=25:35]]

```ad-quote
Insight is a bit like a muscle. If we don't use it, it will atrophy. We need to kind of keep it alive, to consolidate it.
```

```ad-info
check out some thing, or the other.
```

---
##### Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing
**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Insight]] (3) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Conceptual Framework]] · [[Impermanence]] (3) · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Ways of Looking]] (2) · [[Retreat]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=26:23]]

```ad-quote
Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time
```

---
##### Insight as result vs insight as a process
**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Insight]] (5) · [[Personality types]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=27:56]]

```ad-quote
So some people always want to just "be," and just let things arise, and some people are always kind of probing and trying to look differently, or a tendency either way. Both are important, and I would say, maybe not just one way.
```

---
##### Looking at things through certain modes of seeing as insight calms the being
**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-1|8-1]]**: _[[Impermanence]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Breath]] (2) · [[Emotions]] · [[Insight]] · [[Steadiness]] · [[Samadhi]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=28:56]]

---
##### The Four Noble Truths
**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-2|8-2]]**: _[[Ways of Looking]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Four Noble Truths]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (9) · [[Dependent Origination]] · [[Dharma]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=29:52]]

---
##### Whenever there is dukkha, the unawakened mind does something unnecessary to itself
**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (9)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=30:44]]

---
##### Example: grumbling
**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-4|8-4]]**: _[[Letting go]] · [[Insight]] · [[Dukkha]] (3)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=31:57]]

---
##### Is the story I'm telling myself increasing dukkha?
**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (3) · [[Pain]] (2) · [[Aversion]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=33:17]]

---
##### Be aware of subtle kind of delusions of awareness
**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Awareness]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=33:52]]

---
##### The Three Characteristics
**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-3|9-3]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Three characteristics]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Anatta]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=34:57]]

---
##### (1) Impermanence: it is obvious, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?
**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-4|9-4]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (3) · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Attention]] · [[Beauty]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=35:40]]

```ad-quote
Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come.
```

---
##### Using impermance as a lense
**[[1229 What is Insight#^10-1|10-1]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (8) · [[Insight]] · [[Mindfulness]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=36:56]]

---
##### "Take up the theme": seeing impermanence in visual forms, emotions, body sensations, sounds
**[[1229 What is Insight#^10-2|10-2]]**: _[[Buddha]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Impermanence]] (2) · [[Consciousness]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=37:42]]

```ad-quote
Just going through and just focusing on impermanence so that the fact of impermanence begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the consciousness. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way.
```

---
##### You contemplate impermance in the right way, it brings joy
**[[1229 What is Insight#^10-3|10-3]]**: _[[Letting go]] · [[Freedom]] (3) · [[Happiness]] (2) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Ways of Looking]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=38:37]]

```ad-quote
So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of feeling into freedom, of opening up into freedom. It's a way of seeing, a way of looking.
```

---
##### Reflection on death
**[[1229 What is Insight#^10-4|10-4]]**: _[[Death]] (2) · [[Freedom]] · [[Happiness]] · [[Love]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=39:10]]

---
##### Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul", but I don't think that's how insight works
**[[1229 What is Insight#^10-5|10-5]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (5) · [[Buddha]] · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Freedom]] (3) · [[Happiness]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=39:33]]

```ad-quote
So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion, existentially or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else.
```

---
##### (2) Dukkha
**[[1229 What is Insight#^11-1|11-1]]**: _[[Dukkha]] · [[Freedom]] (2) · [[Happiness]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Experience]] · [[Aversion]] · [[Letting go]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=40:43]]

```ad-quote
What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go.
```

---
##### Learn to relax the push and the pull
**[[1229 What is Insight#^11-2|11-2]]**: _[[Dukkha]] · [[Insight]] · [[Aversion]] (4) · [[Craving]] · [[Experience]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=41:42]]

---
##### Just take the way of seeing as a lens and use, deepen, consolidate it
**[[1229 What is Insight#^11-3|11-3]]**: _[[Letting go]] · [[Craving]] (3) · [[Dukkha]] (4) · [[Experience]] (4) · [[Insight]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=42:39]]

---
##### (3) Anatta
**[[1229 What is Insight#^11-4|11-4]]**: _[[Anatta]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Emotions]] · [[Letting go]] (4)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=43:38]]

```ad-quote
It's "not me, not mine." And in that, there's a letting go, a very beautiful letting go. It's not at all about disconnection, dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practicing a mode of seeing, a certain lens.
```

---
##### Just letting go of the aversion in the heart, the heart opens
**[[1229 What is Insight#^12-1|12-1]]**: _[[Pain]] (3) · [[Craving]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Aversion]] (6) · [[Love]] (3) · [[Metta]] (3) · [[Letting go]] · [[Three characteristics]] · [[Dukkha]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=44:35]]

---
##### To the degree we let go, experience fades
**[[1229 What is Insight#^12-2|12-2]]**: _[[Dharma]] · [[Letting go]] (3) · [[Craving]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Anatta]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Emptiness]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=46:15]]

---
##### Going back to mindfulness...
**[[1229 What is Insight#^12-3|12-3]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] · [[Experience]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=46:57]]

---
##### audio cut off for about 20 seconds
[[1229 What is Insight#^12-4|12-4]]

---
##### ... the more we let go of papanca, the more our experience begins to brighten
**[[1229 What is Insight#^12-5|12-5]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (3) · [[Letting go]] (2) · [[Papanca]] · [[Experience]] (3) · [[Attention]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=47:34]]

```ad-quote
There's a kind of radiance that begins to come into one's experience, the more that we're able to meet it in a very direct, very simple, bare way
```

---
##### Letting go makes the now sparkle
**[[1229 What is Insight#^13-1|13-1]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Letting go]] (3) · [[Beauty]] (2) · [[Dharma]] · [[Experience]] · [[Papanca]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=48:33]]

---
##### It can feel that this radiance is the reality ("suchness")
**[[1229 What is Insight#^13-2|13-2]]**: _[[Emptiness#Suchness]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=49:14]]

```ad-quote
Suchness is just the way it exactly is in this moment, without my layers of papañca and preconception - that's not actually what it quite means.
```

```ad-note
so what _does_ suchness mean?
```

---
##### When you don't stop there, experience begins to fade
**[[1229 What is Insight#^13-3|13-3]]**: _[[Letting go]] (3) · [[Dharma]] · [[Ways of Looking]] · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Emptiness]] (2) · [[Consciousness]]_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=49:53]]

```ad-quote
I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness.
```

---
##### Moving towards the Unfabracticated
**[[1229 What is Insight#^13-4|13-4]]**: _[[Buddha]] (2) · [[Skandhas]] (2) · [[Emotions]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Experience]] · [[Emptiness]] (3) · [[Unfabricated]] (2) · [[Phenomenon]] (3)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=50:36]]

---
##### How does the heart respond to this "tearing down the skandhas"?
**[[1229 What is Insight#^14-1|14-1]]**: _[[Dharma]] (2)_

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=51:55]]
